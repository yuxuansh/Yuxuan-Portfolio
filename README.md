# Yuxuan-Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

# About me
Hi! My name is Ushun. I'm a MSPPM student. I found this course interesting and useful because data visualization really matters according to my past internship experiences. An excellent chart could speak for itself without word description while a messy chart could make people confused and even spoils the entire effort to attract clients. I want to be a business analyst after I graduate. Therefore, data visualization is a useful skill to learn!

# What I hope to learn
I would like to learn how to use color properly to make charts clear. Besides, I would like to have deeper understanding about the use of different types of charts, such as pie charts, line graphs, bar charts, etc. How to smartly redesign a chart is also an important tecnique to learn.
