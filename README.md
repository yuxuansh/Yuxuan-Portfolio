This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

# About me
Hi! My name is Ushun. I'm a MSPPM student. I found this course interesting and useful because data visualization really matters according to my past internship experiences. An excellent chart could speak for itself without word description while a messy chart could make people confused and even spoils the entire effort to attract clients. I want to be a business analyst after I graduate. Therefore, data visualization is a useful skill to learn!

# What I hope to learn
I would like to learn how to use color properly to make charts clear. Besides, I would like to have deeper understanding about the use of different types of charts, such as pie charts, line graphs, bar charts, etc. How to smartly redesign a chart is also an important tecnique to learn.

I chose one of the above visualization named "The Most Polpular & Active Social Apps on Android" because I was attracted by the unsual nested pie charts. It looks good at first but has potential problems when I examine it.

To critique the visualization, I referred to the Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile, marking the visualization from 7 perspectives. Overall, it got marks lower than 5 except for the Completeness and Engagement. Then, I critique the visualization by answering 4 questions: What stood out to me? What I found worked really well? What didn't? What I would do differently? After answering the questions, I found it interesting to know that a visualization which looks good at the first glance could be a bad visualization when you examine it further. I thought what I can do to make it not only nice and neat, but convey the idea to the audience quickly. 

# Redesigned Visualization

Below are two feedbacks for the redesigned visualization:

User1
- Can you tell me what you think this is?
This is a bar chart comparing the number of users of 5 social apps.

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?


- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?


User2
- Can you tell me what you think this is?
A bar chart which analyzes Android users.

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?


- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

From their feedbacks 

how you moved next to the wireframes, and any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  
what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  
talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently.
