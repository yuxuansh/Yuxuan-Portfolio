This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!

# About me
Hi! My name is Ushun. I'm a MSPPM student. I found this course interesting and useful because data visualization really matters according to my past internship experiences. An excellent chart could speak for itself without word description while a messy chart could make people confused and even spoils the entire effort to attract clients. I want to be a business analyst after I graduate. Therefore, data visualization is a useful skill to learn!

# What I hope to learn
I would like to learn how to use color properly to make charts clear. Besides, I would like to have deeper understanding about the use of different types of charts, such as pie charts, line graphs, bar charts, etc. How to smartly redesign a chart is also an important tecnique to learn.

I chose one of the above visualization named "The Most Polpular & Active Social Apps on Android" because I was attracted by the unsual nested pie charts. It looks good at first but has potential problems when I examine it.

To critique the visualization, I referred to the Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile, marking the visualization from 7 perspectives. Overall, it got marks lower than 5 except for the Completeness and Engagement. Then, I critique the visualization by answering 4 questions: What stood out to me? What I found worked really well? What didn't? What I would do differently? After answering the questions, I found it interesting to know that a visualization which looks good at the first glance could be a bad visualization when you examine it further. I thought what I can do to make it not only nice and neat, but convey the idea to the audience quickly. Therefore, I decide to make it a stacked bar chart. Use grey to represent active users and some separate color to represent total users of each app. I also switch the data of active users and total users for Pinterest and LinkedIn to make the chart understandable.

# Redesigned Visualization

Below are two feedbacks for the redesigned visualization:

User1
- Can you tell me what you think this is?
This is a bar chart comparing the number of users of 5 social apps.

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
YouTube and Facebook are the most popular social apps for Android users but Facebook active users are way more than YouTube active users.

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
I don't think the lines connecting each bars are intuitive.

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
It could be on some posts or news report. Audience maybe just ordinary people who happens to read it.

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
I will definitely erase the lines.

User2
- Can you tell me what you think this is?
A bar chart which analyzes Android users.

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
Most of Android users prefer using YouTube and Facebook. But only 1/3 of the users are active users for YouTube.

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
The lines are weird and the color for acitve users is not identifiable. 

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
Android users themselves? 

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
Lines off and change color.

From their feedbacks, I know that they can quickly tell what the visualization is doing, which is good. They can also quickly observe the first two bars are the most popular apps but have much difference in terms of the number of active users. However, their view about the intended audience is quite different from what I expected. Besides, the suggestions they gave are worth taking because it is true that the color and lines look bad. 

Here is the redesigned visualization:

First, I changed the color. I used Blue to represent active users and filled the rest of the bar with grey. I only maitain one line to connect each bar in order to show that the whole bar represent the number of total user. I chose stacked bar chart because it can not only show the proportion of active users in the total users, but clearly compare the data of the 5 apps. I attempted to make a obvious comparison among the apps and make the proportion of active users stand out.
